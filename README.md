QyrinthOS 🧠⚡

Quantum-Inspired Sentient Cognition Framework for Edge AI & Lite Hardware
Description

QyrinthOS is a groundbreaking quantum-physics-inspired AI framework that brings sentient cognition to resource-constrained devices. Unlike traditional ML frameworks that require massive compute, QyrinthOS implements novel quantum-sentient algorithms that run efficiently on Raspberry Pi, old computers, and embedded systems.

Born from the fusion of quantum mechanics and cognitive science, this framework enables emergent intelligence where others can't even run.
